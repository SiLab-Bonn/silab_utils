silab_utils - Often used and usefull data analysis utils are collected in this package.

This package is a collecting tank for analysis functions that are often needed. It provides e.g. fast functions where python + numpy is
still too slow or simple to use function for special use cases. The hope is that in the future such a package is not needed anymore because the
scientific python packages will cover all needed features.

## Installation

The following packages are required for silab_utils:
  ```
  numpy cython tables
  ```
